/**
 * @title InterchainProposalSender
 * @dev This contract is responsible for facilitating the execution of approved proposals across multiple chains.
 * It achieves this by working in conjunction with the AxelarGateway and AxelarGasService contracts.
 *
 * The contract allows for the sending of a single proposal to multiple destination chains. This is achieved
 * through the `sendProposals` function, which takes in arrays representing the destination chains,
 * destination contracts, fees, target contracts, amounts of tokens to send, function signatures, and encoded
 * function arguments.
 *
 * Each destination chain has a unique corresponding set of contracts to call, amounts of native tokens to send,
 * function signatures to call, and encoded function arguments. This information is provided in a 2D array where
 * the first dimension is the destination chain index, and the second dimension corresponds to the specific details
 * for each chain.
 *
 * In addition, the contract also allows for the execution of a single proposal at a single destination chain
 * through the `sendProposal` function. This is a more granular approach and works similarly to the
 * aforementioned function but for a single destination.
 *
 * The contract ensures the correctness of the provided proposal details and fees through a series of internal
 * functions that revert the transaction if any of the checks fail. This includes checking if the provided fees
 * are equal to the total value sent with the transaction, if the lengths of the provided arrays match, and if the
 * provided proposal arguments are valid.
 *
 * The contract works in conjunction with the AxelarGateway and AxelarGasService contracts. It uses the
 * AxelarGasService contract to pay for the gas fees of the interchain transactions and the AxelarGateway
 * contract to call the target contracts on the destination chains with the provided encoded function arguments.
